Of course. My apologies for the confusion and the incorrect property reference. You are absolutely right to point out that `default.key.serde` is a Kafka Streams property.

Let's start fresh and provide the correct, verified configuration for a standard **Spring Cloud Stream with the Kafka binder** (no Kafka Streams involved).

### The Core Principle: Multi-Binder Configuration

The overall strategy remains the same and is the correct one for this use case: you will use Spring Cloud Stream's multi-binder capabilities to define two separate binder configurations. Each configuration will be isolated in its own `environment` block, allowing you to specify a unique set of brokers and, most importantly, a unique Schema Registry URL for each.

### Correct Producer/Consumer Properties for the Kafka Binder

Instead of the Kafka Streams `serde` properties, you need to use the standard Kafka client properties for serialization and deserialization. These are typically set under a `configuration` map. When using Avro with a Schema Registry, you will configure the `KafkaAvroSerializer` and `KafkaAvroDeserializer`.

The key properties are:
*   `value.serializer` and `key.serializer` for producers.
*   `value.deserializer` and `key.deserializer` for consumers.

### The Missing Piece: `useNativeEncoding` and `useNativeDecoding`

For this to work correctly, you must tell Spring Cloud Stream to step aside and not perform its own message conversion. You want the `KafkaAvroSerializer` to handle your POJO directly, so it can perform the schema registration and Avro serialization.

This is done with two critical properties on the binding:
*   **For producers:** `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<binding-name>.producer.useNativeEncoding: true`
*   **For consumers:** `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.useNativeDecoding: true`

When these are set to `true`, Spring Cloud Stream passes the application object (e.g., your Avro-generated class) directly to the Kafka client's serializer, which then uses the `schema.registry.url` from its configuration to do its job.

### The Correct and Complete Configuration

Here is a complete `application.yml` example for an application that bridges two different Kafka clusters, each with its own Schema Registry, using explicit bindings.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      # 1. Declare the binding names you intend to use.
      #    This creates MessageChannel beans with these names.
      input-bindings: input-from-a
      output-bindings: output-to-b

      # 2. Define the two named binders, each with its own environment.
      binders:
        clusterA_binder:
          type: kafka
          environment:
            spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder:
              brokers: kafka-a.example.com:9092
              # 3. Provide the Kafka client configuration, including the schema registry URL.
              configuration:
                schema.registry.url: http://schema-registry-a.example.com:8081

        clusterB_binder:
          type: kafka
          environment:
            spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder:
              brokers: kafka-b.example.com:9092
              configuration:
                schema.registry.url: http://schema-registry-b.example.com:8081

      # 4. Configure the bindings, assigning them to the correct binder.
      bindings:
        input-from-a:
          destination: topic-on-cluster-a
          binder: clusterA_binder
          group: my-app-group
          consumer:
            # 5. Enable native decoding to use the configured deserializer.
            useNativeDecoding: true

        output-to-b:
          destination: topic-on-cluster-b
          binder: clusterB_binder
          producer:
            # 6. Enable native encoding to use the configured serializer.
            useNativeEncoding: true

      # 7. Configure the native Kafka SerDes for each binding.
      kafka:
        bindings:
          input-from-a:
            consumer:
              configuration:
                # These get the schema.registry.url from clusterA_binder's environment.
                key.deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
                value.deserializer: io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer
                specific.avro.reader: true # Important for mapping to specific Avro classes

          output-to-b:
            producer:
              configuration:
                # These get the schema.registry.url from clusterB_binder's environment.
                key.serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
                value.serializer: io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroSerializer
```

### Application Code Example

Your application code would then look like this, using `StreamBridge` to send messages and a standard `@Bean` `Consumer` to receive them.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.stream.function.StreamBridge;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import com.example.avro.MyRecordFromA;
import com.example.avro.MyRecordForB;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ExplicitBindingApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ExplicitBindingApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public Consumer<MyRecordFromA> inputFromA(StreamBridge streamBridge) {
        return recordFromA -> {
            System.out.println("Received from Cluster A: " + recordFromA);
            
            // Transform and create a record for cluster B
            MyRecordForB recordForB = new MyRecordForB();
            // ... map fields from recordFromA to recordForB
            
            // Send to the output binding for cluster B
            streamBridge.send("output-to-b", recordForB);
        };
    }
}
```

This configuration correctly isolates the properties for each binder, ensuring that the Avro SerDes for each one communicate with their designated Schema Registry.
